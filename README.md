# Break-Down-Tech

Break Down Tech is an interactive game aimed to teach adult and seniors the basics of an iPhone. The application features a quizlet-style game that generates questions based on an AI algorithm, which uses the individual user's mistakes as its data. A self-implemented decision tree also allows the questions to be generated based on the individual user's progress, along with past users that have played the game. Lastly, users' progress is always saved to their accounts, so they can continue their learning at later dates.
